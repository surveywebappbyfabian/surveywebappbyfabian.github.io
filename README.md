Can be handy when conducting on site survey computations. 
# Survey App

A comprehensive web application for various surveying and geodetic calculations.

## Features

This app includes the following computations and conversions:

1. Forward Computation
2. Backward Computation
3. Resection
4. Intersection
5. Area Calculation
6. Long/Lat ⇄ UTM Conversion
7. DD ⇄ DMS Conversion

## Usage

Each computation/conversion has its own dedicated page with intuitive input fields and clear instructions.

### Forward Computation
Calculate the coordinates of a new point given a starting point, distance, and bearing.

### Backward Computation
Calculate the distance and bearing between two known points.

### Resection
Determine the position of an unknown point using observations to three known points.

### Intersection
Find the coordinates of an unknown point using angles measured from two known points.

### Area Calculation
Calculate the area of a polygon given its vertex coordinates.

### Long/Lat ⇄ UTM Conversion
Convert between geographic (longitude/latitude) and UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator) coordinates.

### DD ⇄ DMS Conversion
Convert between decimal degrees and degrees, minutes, seconds formats.
